Alarm Clock Web App ⏰

Live Demo: https://shravaniii06.github.io/alarm-clock/

A modern and responsive Alarm Clock web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
This app lets users set multiple alarms, choose alarm tones, and handles snooze/dismiss functionality.

Features

Real-Time Clock — shows current time and date.
Add Alarms — set multiple alarms with chosen time and ringtone.
Alarm Management — view, delete, and manage multiple alarms.
Ringtone Selection — choose from multiple tones.
Snooze & Dismiss — ring until dismissed, or snooze for 5 minutes.
Modern UI — stylish responsive interface.

How It Works

The clock updates every second and checks saved alarms.
When current time matches an active alarm, the app plays the selected alarm sound until dismissed or snoozed.
